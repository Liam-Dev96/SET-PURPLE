     This issue consists of maintaining reference values of different equipment types using a set of CRUD functions connected to a local database.

  First, I created a new branch and named it [EquipmentTypes](https://github.com/xinjoonha/SET09102_PURPLE/tree/EquipmentTypes) , during its development I commited several changes. The database table was redesigned to suit the needs of the issue and built according to the requirements, along with new files for UI to display a list of equipment types with buttons to perform CRUD functions.

  Every Change was documented to make sure the team know whats going on with the branch.

Currently the branch does not meet the Definition of Done as it is not complete and does not meet the requirements as of yet.

  Select the two branches you wish to compare write a comment and press create pull request.

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;    
  
Once the request is sent it is sent for review and when the team think it is okay it gets merged with the main branch and the issue can now be closed.

  # Reflection.  
there were several problems i ran into as i was unfamiliar with databases in C# and using the .NET MAUI framework a couple of those problems still persist but i am rapidly learning the new technology.   
The Android Emulator seems to have an issue running this app so an android phone was directly connected to see if the program would run.  

The current process seems to working so far and every seems to be doing their tasks fairly successfully, however, a few branches have some major conflicts that need to be resolved. Updating the tasks seems to be set to manual removal this seems appropriate since conlicts have occuured and the task wont auto delete.  
Everyone communicates so there isnt two people working on the same task by accident, even if there are conflicts the team can talk and see who needs help or help look for errors.
