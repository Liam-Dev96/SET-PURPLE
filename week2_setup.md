# Setting Up the Environment.  
First I installed Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition [here.](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

  after the installer has downloaded its time to select the workloads for the project.  
  The project will be written in C# using the .NET MAUI framework so that the project  
  is cross-platform.

  </figure>  
  
  &nbsp;  
  
  the group decided on the standard configuration of the git project, the project is set  
  to private so that only approved contributors can make changes, pull and push requests etc.  
  After the project is created to clone the repository to Visual Studio click 'code'.  
  Then copy the repository link.

  <figcaption align = "centre"><b>Figure 3</b></figcaption>  
  </figure>  
  
  &nbsp;  
  
  Open Visual Studio and click 'Clone Repository'

  <figcaption align = "centre"><b>Figure 4</b></figcaption>  
  </figure>  
  
  &nbsp;  
  
  Paste the repository link into the text box and hit clone.  
    <figure>

  <figcaption align = "centre"><b>Figure 5</b></figcaption>  
  </figure>  
  
  &nbsp;  

  Git successfully cloned ready for project start.

from here i can create the files required from the requirements of the project and update the project on both local server and pushing changes to git.

  # Reflection.  
  The current set up and configuration for this project is needed as this project invloves creating a cross-platform app that will need to be available when internet isn't, this will need a local database to achieve this.  
    
  &nbsp;  

on top of this due to not having used github very much before this project made it a little bit difficult to get set up as visual studio code and its build tools interfered with visual studio 2022 community edition.  
 The cause of the problem was not found, however, uninstalling visual studio code and the build tools and only having visual studio 2022 fixed the issue and the rest of the set up went without any other issues.
